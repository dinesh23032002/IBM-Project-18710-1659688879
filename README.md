PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Skin diseases are the most common among the world, as people get skin disease due to allergies, immune system problems and environmental factors. Skin diseases are conditions that affect your skin. These diseases may cause rashes, inflammation, itchiness or other skin changes. In many cases people ignore the impact of skin disease at the early stage. The skin disease is identified using Biopsy method of removing a small piece of skin to examine under a microscope, Culture method of taking a skin sample to test for bacteria fungus or viruses and the Skin patch test of applying small amounts of substances to test for allergic reactions.
 So, we propose a hybrid approach method of AI based machine learning techniques to overcome this manual inspection. For this the input images would be microscopic images i.e histopathological from which features like colour, shape and texture are extracted and given to convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification and disease identification. Our objective of the project is to detect the type of skin disease easily with accuracy and recommend the best and global medical suggestions.
